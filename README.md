This code example was originally sourced from http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/java-basics/java-comparable-example/ in order to demonstrate the concept of automating testing using the main method inside the bean class.

Run PersonsCollection.java to enter data using the UI (console), and run Person.java
to test the class against an automated data set.
